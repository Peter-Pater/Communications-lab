			<img id="mustafi" width="450" src="mustafi.jpg">
			<p>
				Shkodran Mustafi (born 17 April 1992) is a German professional footballer who plays as a central defender for English club Arsenal and the Germany national team.
				<br>
				He began his career in the youth ranks of Hamburger SV and English club Everton, where he made one substitute appearance in two-and-a-half-years before leaving to Sampdoria in January 2012. He signed a five-year deal at Valencia in August 2014.
				<br>
				Mustafi made his full international debut against Poland on 13 May 2014, and was part of the German team which won the 2014 FIFA World Cup.
				On 27 August 2016, Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger said that Mustafi had completed a medical examination and will join Arsenal after the international break. A few days later, on 30 August 2016, the transfer was confirmed by the club, for an undisclosed fee, believed to be in excess of £35 million.

		<h2><u>LATEST MATCH REVIEW</u></h2>
		<h3>Arsenal won 2-1 in the game facing South Ampton at Emirates Stadium</h3>
		<div>
			<img id="latest_match" width="450" src="latest_match.jpg">
			<p>
			<strong>SUMMARY</strong><br>

			Santi Cazorla’s stoppage-time penalty snatched three points for Arsenal to get their home campaign up and running.<br>
			Arsène Wenger's side faced an uphill task when Petr Cech inadvertently gave the Saints the lead, brilliantly tipping Dusan Tadic’s free-kick onto the bar only for the rebound to hit him on the back and bounce in.
			Laurent Koscielny came to the rescue, marking his birthday with a stunning overhead kick.<br>
			Driven on by Francis Coquelin, Arsenal made the running in the second half, but the closest they went was a shot from Alexis that whistled just over the bar.<br>
			That was until the dying seconds, when Olivier Giroud was hauled down by Jose Fonte and Cazorla kept his nerve to beat Fraser Forster.
			It was just enough to end Southampton’s resistance - and make it two straight wins in the Premier League.
