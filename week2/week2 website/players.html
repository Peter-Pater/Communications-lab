		<h2><u>THE LEGEND</u></h2>
		<div>
		<img id="henry" width = "300" src="henry.jpg">

		<h3>The best player in the club history - Thierry Henry</h3>

			<p>
				The Frenchman had exquisite technique, searing pace and surprising strength. And like the typical <br>schoolboy superstar, he did pretty much everything for his team. Henry was the captain, the talisman,<br> the dead-ball expert, the penalty-taker and the assist-maker.<br>
				Then there's the goals, a club record 228 of them to be precise. And what a portfolio Henry built <br>up during his eight years as Arsenal. Thumping drives, delicate chips, jinking runs, audacious backheels, <br>even the odd header - the Frenchman had myriad ways to find the net.<br>

		<h2><u>THE STARS</u></h2>
		<h3><u>Alexis Sanchez</u></h3>

			<p>
				Alexis Alejandro Sánchez Sánchez, born 19 December 1988, also known as simply Alexis, is a Chilean professional footballer who plays as a forward for English club Arsenal and the Chilean national team.
				<br>
				After his debut season of first-team football with Cobreloa, Sánchez was signed by Italy's Udinese Calcio in 2006. Following successful loans at Colo-Colo and River Plate, he began playing in Serie A. In 2011, he was signed by Barcelona for £25 million, becoming the most expensive transfer in Chilean football history. Sánchez signed for Arsenal in July 2014 for a fee reported to be £31.7 million, making him the third-most expensive signing in the club's history after Mesut Özil and Granit Xhaka.
				<br>
				Sánchez has been a full international for Chile since 2006, and has earned 100 caps, making him the team's second-most capped player of all time after goalkeeper Claudio Bravo. With 34 goals, he is their third top scorer of all time. He played in two FIFA World Cups (2010 and 2014) as well as three Copa América tournaments, winning two of the latter.

		<h3><u>Mesut Özil</u></h3>

			<img id="ozil" width = "400" src="ozil.jpg">
			<p>
				Mesut Özil (born 15 October 1988) is a German footballer who plays for English club Arsenal and the German national team. Özil has been a youth national team member since 2006, and a member of the German national team since 2009. He gained international attention during the 2010 FIFA World Cup and was nominated for the Golden Ball Award, which is awarded to the tournament's best player. Özil started his senior career at hometown club Schalke in the Bundesliga in 2006, transferred to Werder Bremen in 2008 and was signed by Real Madrid in August 2010 following his break-out performance at the FIFA World Cup with Germany. On transfer deadline day of summer 2013, he moved to Arsenal for a club-record fee of £42.5 million. The transfer makes him the most expensive German football player of all time.
				<br>
				Özil is acclaimed for his finesse and improvisation as an attacking midfielder. His style and ability for providing assists for his team-mates has been compared by former manager José Mourinho to that of Real Madrid legend Zinedine Zidane. In 2010–11, Özil ranked first in assists in major European and domestic competitions with 25. In 2011–12, he ranked first in assists in La Liga with 17. Özil was the joint-highest assist provider at both the 2010 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2012, registering three at each tournament.
